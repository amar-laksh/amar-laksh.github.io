## Mental Landscapes?

> They are places for your thoughts to grow through absorption of stuff.

## Form, Function and Context of stuff

## Observations

You feel good about yourself for thinking the subtext of the text.

### 4. Analogy type of stuff. (Functional or observational)

### 5. Notice the outdated stuff.

## Observation (not stuff)

### 1. Believe people in what they say.

### 2. Notice the diff between speech and action

### 3. Identity, Ethics/Morals, belonging

### 4. Dialectics (in n-dimensions)
