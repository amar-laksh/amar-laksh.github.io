title: "Lingering"
draft: false

A hook of sharp stainless steel is stuck in sinew, <br/>
Prying open the glorious goo of thought. <br/>
There’s crackling to be heard from inside, <br/>
An unbroken nibble of some old, shitty thing you ate, <br/>
Stuck in the crevice of a tooth’s edge. <br/>
The blinding headlights of enlightenment, <br/>
shrieking with a constant boom at your tongue. <br/>
Nostalgic, rotten bits of tuberculosis <br/>
Is pumping iron in your chest. <br/>
Your algorithms are burrowing into the gut, <br/>
And you politely inquire about kosher salt. <br/>
There’s a lingering sense of lingering in the time, <br/>
And you pause and patiently wait for the end.
