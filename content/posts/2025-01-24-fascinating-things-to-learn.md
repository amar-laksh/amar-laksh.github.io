# Financial systems


### Accounting model of the UK Exechequer:

Context: Most work on this topic seems to be in the [Modern Monetary Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_monetary_theory) sphere of academics. 

So it's probably a good idea to keep in mind that the governing bias in that sphere revolves around redistributive politics on one end and potential backing from the private equity crowd on the other (hypothetically to create more consumer demand through policies like [UBI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_basic_income)) 

The main openly available research about this topic is in the following paper:

[An Accounting Model of the UK Exchequer â€“ 2nd edition](!https://gimms.org.uk/2021/02/21/an-accounting-model-of-the-uk-exchequer/)

A really nice summary of the paper can also be found in the academic talk:

[How the UK government finances its spending: an Accounting Model of the UK Exchequer. ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JJJcB3X3ag)

My take on it:
- There definitely needs to be more open research into the nature of these accounting systems of the central banks of various countries.
- Seems like the UK exchequer accounting could benefit from more parliamentary enquiry and access to 
- Also apparently, if the model is correct, government policies have much lesser impact on the0 country than the nexus between the Treasury and the Bank of England which has been pretty apparent in the financial circles already. A tangentially related curious story can be found in this article from [Financial Times](https://www.ft.com/content/5209be99-3f6b-4ba3-b3f3-49b544f71c28).

Further Links:
- I found the financial accounting manual for the Fedral Reserve of America. It provides a lot of detail into how things are structured inside the Fed. Seems like a pretty interesting place to start if you want to understand the Fed a bit more. [Fed Financial Statements](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/financial-accounting-manual-for-federal-reserve-banks.htm)
- For a lot of Anglo-derived government systems, [The Consolidated Fund](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consolidated_Fund) is the main government bank account.

- The Fed also works with other major central banks in issuing a special international reserve asset called [Special Drawing Rights (IMF)](https://www.imf.org/en/About/Factsheets/Sheets/2023/special-drawing-rights-sdr) (another useful link is the Wikipedia one on [SDR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_drawing_rights)) which is mainly issued to countries in order to help with climate change these days among other things.


### The actions of central banks during the 2007-08 crisis

Context: A lot of commentary is based around the causes of the crises, from a crazy housing market originally freed by the Clinton Administration

Honestly the best resource is [Crashed](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36950522-crashed) by Adam Tooze. He goes into great detail about how the central banks and those in charge used existing and created entirely new ways of holding up a global financial system facing a terminal heart attack as he put it. The sheer amount of technocratic prowess is impressive no matter which way you sway politically.
