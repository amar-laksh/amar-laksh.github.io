# Financial systems


### Accounting model of the UK Exechequer:

Context: Most work on this topic seems to be in the [Modern Monetary Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_monetary_theory) sphere of academics. 

So it's probably a good idea to keep in mind that the governing bias in that sphere revolves around redistributive politics on one end and potential backing from the private equity crowd on the other (hypothetically to create more consumer demand through policies like [UBI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_basic_income)) 

The main openly available research about this topic is in the following paper:

[An Accounting Model of the UK Exchequer â€“ 2nd edition](!https://gimms.org.uk/2021/02/21/an-accounting-model-of-the-uk-exchequer/)

A really nice summary of the paper can also be found in the academic talk:

[How the UK government finances its spending: an Accounting Model of the UK Exchequer. ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JJJcB3X3ag)

My take on it:
- There definitely needs to be more open research into the nature of these accounting systems of the central banks of various countries.
- Seems like the UK exchequer accounting could benefit from more parliamentary enquiry and public access. 
- Also apparently, if the model is correct, government policies have much lesser impact on the country than the nexus between the Treasury and the Bank of England which has been pretty apparent in the financial circles already. A tangentially related curious story can be found in this article from [Financial Times](https://www.ft.com/content/5209be99-3f6b-4ba3-b3f3-49b544f71c28).

Further Links:
- I found the financial accounting manual for the Fedral Reserve of America. It provides a lot of detail into how things are structured inside the Fed. Seems like a pretty interesting place to start if you want to understand the Fed a bit more. [Fed Financial Statements](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/financial-accounting-manual-for-federal-reserve-banks.htm)
- For a lot of Anglo-derived government systems, [The Consolidated Fund](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consolidated_Fund) is the main government bank account.

- The Fed also works with other major central banks in issuing a special international reserve asset called [Special Drawing Rights (IMF)](https://www.imf.org/en/About/Factsheets/Sheets/2023/special-drawing-rights-sdr) (another useful link on SDR is the [Wikipedia one](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_drawing_rights)) which is mainly issued to countries in order to help with climate change among other things these days.


### The actions of central banks during the 2007-08 crisis

Context: A lot of commentary is based around the causes of the crises. Most of it focuses on it originating as an American problem that spread everywhere. However, the story is a bit more complicated than that.

Honestly the best resource is [Crashed](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36950522-crashed) by Adam Tooze. 


He goes into great detail about how the central banks and those in charge used existing and newly created ways of holding up a global financial system facing a terminal heart attack as he put it. The sheer amount of technocratic prowess is impressive no matter which way you sway politically. Also he investigated how it wasn't just a US-UK caused problem but a result of the entire global market getting into the originally American housing bubble. Definitely worth a read.


A good summary of the book can be found in the talk by the Author here:

- [Central bank liquidity swap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank_liquidity_swap) has been a key instrument of stabilizing the economies countries around the world during and after the crises.
- [Central Bank Currency Swaps Tracker](https://www.cfr.org/tracker/central-bank-currency-swaps-tracker) pretty handy tracker to see the swaps in action.
- [List of Systematically important banks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_systemically_important_banks) if you have money/connections in/to these banks, I am pretty sure you're gonna be okay until the end of the world.
